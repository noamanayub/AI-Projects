# Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking System

This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using the YOLOv8 model. The system can detect and track various objects in a video stream, estimate their speed, and display the count of moving and stationary objects.

## Features

- Real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8.
- Speed estimation of moving objects in meters per second (m/s).
- Display of the count of moving and stationary objects.
- Resizing of video frames for better visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noamanayub/Object-Detection-Tracking.git
   cd Object-Detection-Tracking
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Main Script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Video**:
   - The script expects a video file named `test.mp4` in the project directory. You can modify the `video_path` variable in `main.py` to use a different video file.

3. **Output**:
   - The script will display the video stream with bounding boxes around detected objects, their speeds, and the count of moving and stationary objects.
   - Press `q` to exit the video stream.

## Configuration

- **Model Path**: The YOLOv8 model is loaded from `yolov8n.pt`. Ensure this file is in the same directory as `main.py` or provide the correct path.
- **Video Path**: The video file path is set to `./test.mp4`. Modify this in `main.py` if you want to use a different video file.
- **Detection Thresholds**: The confidence and NMS thresholds can be adjusted in `main.py` to improve detection accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Video Capture Issues**: Ensure the video file path is correct and the file is accessible.
- **Performance Issues**: If the system is running slowly, consider reducing the video frame size or using a more powerful GPU.
