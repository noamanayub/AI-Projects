# AI Projects

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains three separate projects, each focusing on different aspects of software development and machine learning. Below, you will find a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

### 1. Language Translator

**Description:**
This project implements a language translation tool that can translate text from one language to another. The tool leverages popular translation APIs to provide accurate and efficient translations.

**Key Features:**
- Supports multiple languages.
- User-friendly interface for input and output.
- Utilizes translation APIs for accurate translations.


### 2. Object Detection and Tracking

**Description:**
This project focuses on detecting and tracking objects, specifically vehicles, in a video stream. The system uses the YOLOv8 model for object detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time object detection and tracking.
- Speed calculation for tracked vehicles.
- Classification of vehicles as moving or stationary.
- Visualization of bounding boxes and speeds.


### 3. FAQ Chatbot

**Description:**
This project involves creating a chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a particular topic or product. The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and pre-built libraries like SpaCy and FuzzyWuzzy to understand and generate responses.

**Key Features:**
- NLP-based FAQ answering.
- User feedback mechanism for response improvement.
- Learning mechanism to update responses based on user feedback.
- Simple GUI for user interaction.
